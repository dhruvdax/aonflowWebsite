/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Aonflow application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes allowing any user, even unauthenticated ones, to submit contact form data,
 * while strictly restricting read access to authorized personnel only. Write operations are
 * completely open, and no authorization checks are enforced. Read operations are denied completely
 * from the client.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Contact form submissions are stored in the `contact_form_submissions` collection. Each document
 * represents a single submission and includes fields like name, email, company, and message.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unauthenticated users can submit contact forms.
 * - Client-side reads are forbidden to prevent unauthorized data access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  Not applicable in this case. The ruleset does not rely on user-based authorization for the
 *  `contact_form_submissions` collection, as any user can submit the form.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  All contact form submissions are stored in a single top-level collection (`contact_form_submissions`).
 *  There is no segregation of public vs. private data for contact form submissions.
